# Statement
### Project name: A complete DMA driver
### Project description: You are required to develop a complete software driver for the DMA peripheral in the STM32F401 MCU.
### Project requirements:
* Your driver should provide the following APIs
    1. A function to initialize the DMA driver.
    2. A function to initialize the DMA channel parameters, DMA Peripheral ID, Trigger source, Source address, destination address number of transfers, transfer item size, transfer mode, transfer type(Single or burst).
    3. A function to request from the driver to start software transfer (memory to memory).
    4. A function to check the transfer state.
* You have to configure the DMA interrupt and in the DMA ISR you have to call an notification function for the DMA client.
* Your test code should be a dummy client that create two arrays of integers of size 100 elements. One of them is already initialized with numbers of 100,200, … till the end. This will be the source array.
* The second one is the destination array with the same type and size and will be initialized by all zeros.
* Your DMA driver shall be used to copy the source array into the destination array.
